##Bio
<img src="images/christopher_aicher_ski.jpg" alt="Christopher Aicher" align="right" style="height:140px; width:140px; margin:0px 20px">
I am a fifth year statistics PhD student at the [University of Washington](http://www.stat.washington.edu/) working with [Emily B. Fox](https://www.stat.washington.edu/~ebfox/).
Prior to studying at the University of Washington, I obtained a BS/MS degree in Applied Mathematics from the University of Colorado, advised by [Aaron Clauset](http://tuvalu.santafe.edu/~aaronc/).

##Research
My research interests are in scalable approximate inference methods for machine learning,
specifically using deterministic Bayesian approximations (e.g. Expectation Propagation and Variational Inference)
and stochastic gradient MCMC methods (e.g. SGLD).
My research projects include:

* Stochastic Gradient Methods for Time Series
* Adaptive Truncation of Backpropagation in Recurrent Neural Networks
* Community Detection in Weighted Network Data using Variational Inference
* Time Series Clustering using Expectation Propagation

##Experience
* Research Intern, *Microsoft AI and Research* (*06/17-09/17*)
    * Worked with Consumer Data \& Analytics team on short-form text clustering.
    * Developed an online feature extractor using RNNs and non-parametric clustering.
* Research Scientist Intern, *Amazon* (*06/16-09/16*)
    * Worked with the Kindle devices demand planning team on forecasting sales.
    * Developed a custom R package for prototyping new models.
    * Tested and integrated quantile random forests to improve short-term forecasting
* Machine Learning Intern, *Dato* (now *Turi/Apple*) (*06/15-09/15*)
    * Researched, developed, and shipped a new itemset mining toolkit as part
 of GraphLab Create's machine learning applications library.
