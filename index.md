##Hello world!

### Subheading

This is a **test**.

A few things about me:

* I love machine learning
* My favorite sports team is the *Green Bay Packers*
* I'd recommend reading *The Way of Kings* by Brandon Sanderson


### Statistics

I like statistics. 
My favorite equation is *Bayes Rule*

$$
\Pr( \theta \ | \ D) \propto \Pr( D \ | \ \theta) \Pr(\theta) 
$$

where the normalization constant is

$$
\sum_{\theta' \ \in \ \Theta} \Pr( D \ | \ \theta') \Pr(\theta') \enspace.
$$

### Code

I also enjoy writing in `python`

``` python
def writing_code(time, energy):
    """ Code takes time and energy """
    time += -10  # Coding reduces time
    energy *= 0.9  # Coding reduces energy
    if time > 0:
        excellent_python_code = True
        return excellent_python_code
    else:
        return None
```
