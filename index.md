##Bio
<img src="images/christopher_aicher_ski.jpg" alt="Christopher Aicher" align="right" style="height:140px; width:140px; margin:0px 20px">
I am a fourth year statistics PhD student at the [University of Washington](http://www.stat.washington.edu/) working with [Emily B. Fox](https://www.stat.washington.edu/~ebfox/).

Prior to studying at the University of Washington, I obtained a BS/MS degree in Applied Mathematics from the University of Colorado Boulder, advised by [Aaron Clauset](http://tuvalu.santafe.edu/~aaronc/).

##Research
My research interests are in scalable approximate inference methods for machine learning,
specifically deterministic Bayesian approximations (e.g. Expectation Propagation and Variational Inference)
and stochastic gradient MCMC methods (e.g. SGLD).

##Experience
* Microsoft Research Intern, *MSR* (*06/17-09/17*)
* Research Scientist Intern, *Amazon* (*06/16-09/16*)
* Machine Learning Intern, *Dato* (now *Turi/Apple*) (*06/15-09/15*)
