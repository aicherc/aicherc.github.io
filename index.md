##Bio
<img src="images/christopher_aicher_ski.jpg" alt="Christopher Aicher" align="right" style="height:140px; width:140px; margin:0px 20px">
I am a quantitative researcher at [Citadel Securities](https://www.citadelsecurities.com/) in Chicago.
I received a PhD from the [Department of Statistics](http://www.stat.washington.edu/) at the University of Washington where I was advised by [Emily B. Fox](https://www.stat.washington.edu/~ebfox/).
Prior to my PhD at the University of Washington, I received a BS and MS degree from the [Department of Applied Mathematics](https://www.colorado.edu/amath/) at the University of Colorado where I was advised by [Aaron Clauset](http://tuvalu.santafe.edu/~aaronc/).

##Research
My research interests are in scalable approximate inference methods for machine learning,
specifically using deterministic Bayesian approximations (e.g. Expectation Propagation and Variational Inference)
and stochastic gradient MCMC methods (e.g. SGLD).
My research projects include:

* [Stochastic Gradient Methods for Time Series](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.09098)
* [Adaptive Truncation of Backpropagation in Recurrent Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.07473)
* [Community Detection in Weighted Network Data using Variational Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/1404.0431)
* [Time Series Clustering using Expectation Propagation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.07621)
